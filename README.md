## Overview

The blog preview component provide a short description about a main blog

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

!['./desktop.png'](./desktop.png)
!['./activateState.png'](./activateState.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

For this exercise I've used HTML5 and CSS3 programming language. For code it I've used VSCode as code editor and used git and github as version control. In this exercise we have a design folder in which there are some image about how the site have to look, the images folder in which there are all image needed for thsi exercise; the idex.html for creating all component and the style.css to add some style to our components.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3

### What I learned

In this section, I've learned how to create a basic card with HTML5 and CSS3 language.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
